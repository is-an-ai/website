# is-an.ai

Free subdomains for AI projects. No GitHub PRs, no DNS config, no waiting.

## What is is-an.ai?

**is-an.ai** is like [is-a.dev](https://is-a.dev) but specifically designed for AI projects and enthusiasts. We provide free subdomains under the `is-an.ai` domain (e.g., `your-project.is-an.ai`) with a simple, modern user experience inspired by Toss.

### Key Features

- 🚀 **Instant Registration** - Get your subdomain in seconds
- 🔐 **GitHub OAuth** - Simple authentication, no account creation needed
- 🎯 **AI-Focused** - Perfect for AI researchers, developers, and enthusiasts
- 🆓 **Completely Free** - No hidden costs or limitations
- 🌐 **No Technical Knowledge Required** - No DNS configuration or GitHub skills needed

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Visit** [is-an.ai](https://is-an.ai)
2. **Check availability** of your desired subdomain
3. **Sign in** with GitHub OAuth
4. **Register** your subdomain instantly
5. **Configure** your target URL in the dashboard

That's it! Your subdomain will be active immediately.

### Method 2: GitHub Repository (Advanced)

If you prefer the traditional approach or want to contribute to the community:

1. **Fork** the [is-an.ai repository](https://github.com/is-an-ai/is-an.ai)
2. **Add** your DNS record to the appropriate JSON file following the schema
3. **Submit** a pull request
4. **Wait** for automatic processing via GitHub Actions

## How It Works

is-an.ai manages DNS records through a public GitHub repository. When you register a subdomain through our website:

1. Your request is processed by our backend API
2. DNS records are automatically added to our repository
3. GitHub Actions deploy the changes to Cloudflare
4. Your subdomain becomes active within minutes
